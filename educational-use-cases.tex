\section{Design Rationale: Educational use cases}

Since CodeInk targets instructors and students in CS education, we looked to two
main sources to guide its design: (1) lecture videos of instructors tracing
algorithms on blackboards, and (2) best practices from educational psychology.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Concrete traces}
We observed that instructors explain algorithms by drawing a concrete example of
a data structure - for example, a specific list when explaining insertion sort
(\fig{fig:6006-insertion}) - and then trace the algorithm's behavior on that
example. We call this a \emph{concrete trace}, because the instructor does not
explain the algorithm in general, or draw flow control on the board.
Instead, they unfold the loops and branches of an algorithm's pseudocode into a
sequence of concrete steps.
% other than by referring to pseudocode written elsewhere on the board.

This approach is in line with findings that students need to see multiple
examples of an algorithm's behavior to build their
understanding~\cite{Vainio2007}.
Also, according to cognitive load theory, novices can learn better by watching
experts solve problems that would be too difficult for novices to solve on their
own~\cite{Linn1992}. The instructor's worked examples give students an
opportunity to get the gist of an algorithm, before they attempt to trace it on
their own. For these reasons, CodeInk targets the teacher's task of describing,
recording and disseminating concrete traces of algorithms.

\subsection{Level of abstraction}
The instructor's explanation occurs at a high level of abstraction.
They rarely write language-specific code on the board (e.g. in Python), and will
instead opt for a combination of pseudocode and data structure diagrams. We
hypothesize that this is because the pseudocode and diagrams abstract away
language-specific details that are not essential to understanding the strategy
behind the algorithm. This should not be confused with the previous point: the
traced steps are concrete, and do not include control abstraction (e.g. loops).
As a result, CodeInk focuses on enabling tracing by direct manipulation of data
structure diagrams.

\subsection{Visual vocabulary}
When drawing data structures, instructors use a familiar, consistent visual
vocabulary:
lists are drawn as a row of boxes (Fig. \ref{fig:6006-insertion}), and trees and
graphs are drawn as circles connected by arrows (Fig.
\ref{fig:6006-bst}, \ref{fig:6006-dijkstra}). To represent its value, each list
element, node or edge has a number inscribed within or adjacent to it; all
examples in lecture videos we watched were numerical. We designed CodeInk's
visual vocabulary to mirror these conventions.

Instructors add to this vocabulary using arrows and colors. Arrows are
interchangably used to show transitions between storyboard frames, and as
fingers pointing to the current focus of the algorithm (Fig.
\ref{fig:6006-insertion}). The former is an artifact of the need to draw
snapshots when using blackboards, while the latter is an important visual cue
for students to follow the algorithm's progress. Colors are also used to
visualize state: when nodes needed to be marked as visited, or list elements as
sorted, they are filled with a different color. CodeInk's visual vocabulary
includes \emph{fingers}, which can be attached to any on-screen object, and a
\emph{fill} gesture (explained later) that can be used to fill an object.

\subsection{Student traces and targeted feedback}
In a multi-national study, Lister et. al~\cite{Lister2004} found that students
in introductory programming courses could not consistently demonstrate an
understanding of code by manually tracing it. The researchers noted that ``even
when our principal aim is to teach students to write code, we require students
to learn by reading code'', and suggested that tracing code is therefore a
prerequisite skill for problem sovling and the ability to write programs. They
further stated that programming courses should ``first teach systematic tracing
as a base skill, then allow students to build [\ldots] upon that''.

Apart from being an authoring tool for instructors, we see CodeInk as a learning
environment that enables students to practice the basic skill of tracing
pseudocode on example data structures. The student has the freedom to explore
the algorithm's behavior, perhaps making mistakes along the way.
Realizing the importance of targeted feedback~\cite{Balzer1989}, we designed
CodeInk to record the student's effort, so a teacher can provide feedback on not
just the final answer, but also the process by which they reached it.

%Finally, students eventually need to learn to write algorithms in a real
%programming language. CodeInk provides a mapping from visual data
%structure changes to lines of Python code. This serves as a form of
%instructional scaffolding~\cite{Pea2004} to help students acquire
%basic programming skills.

\begin{comment}

CodeInk supports three main educational use cases:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt

\item Instructors can easily create algorithm explanations that can be
used in a live class or disseminated online.

\item Students can step through instructor-created explanations to learn
both the algorithms and basic Python constructs, such as list
manipulation operators.

\item Students can solidify their understanding by tracing an algorithm
on new input data. CodeInk records all user interactions, which enables
instructors to give targeted feedback~\cite{Balzer1989} on the student's
problem-solving process.

\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

%Tracing algorithms is ubiquitous, fundamental
Tracing algorithms on concrete examples is fundamental to how teachers and students in
computer science explain and learn, respectively. On the blackboard, teachers explain an
algorithm for the first time by drawing an example data structure and carrying
out the algorithm's operation on the example. Similarly, before
attempting problem sets and coding assignments,
students often review algorithms by reading pseudocode and
tracing through multiple examples on paper~\cite{Vainio2007}.
% mentally tracing the algorithm's behavior

% Tedious, limiting no manipulation affordances no persistent, structured
% recording
This process of tracing algorithms on blackboards and paper can be both tedious and
limiting. First, blackboards and paper do not afford manipulation of the
drawing. To demonstrate changes, the user must erase, redraw, and
storyboard the behavior as a series of static snapshots.
Second, the drawing is not recorded in a persistent, structured format, so it
can be hard for students and teachers to share ideas and discuss
problems unless they are co-located.
This limitation is particularly problematic in a MOOC context, where the majority of
students do not have direct, real-time access to teaching staff.

manipulation gesture set for tracing algorithms on data structures for the
purpose of CS education. CodeInk allows the user to (a) compose and
manipulate data structures on a graphical canvas, (b) step forward and
backward through the recorded trace, and (c) see each step translated
into a line of Python code or an English explanation.}

%The CodeInk user interface is (a) a canvas for composing and
%manipulating data structures and (c) an interactive list of Python steps
%recorded by the tool, based on the user's interactions. The user can
%step forward and backward through the steps, or replay the entire trace
%using the playback controls (b).}

% Code-driven visualization is for visualization, not explanation or
% active learning Also at the wrong level of abstraction
Code-driven program visualizations~\cite{Sorva2013} are an alternative
to manually drawing traces on blackboard or paper. Using a program
visualization tool, the user can type in code that implements an
algorithm and then watch a step-by-step animation of its execution.
However, the code that implements an algorithm is usually at a lower
level of abstraction than the language-agnostic level at which the
algorithm should be explained and learned. Also, watching a
visualization is passive learning, whereas tracing requires the student
to play the role of the computer and carry out the algorithm's behavior.
This form of active learning leads to better learning
outcomes~\cite{Sorva2012Diss}.

The ideal user interface for pedagogy should combine the flexibility of
blackboard and paper with the automation and persistence of code-driven
visualizations. This paper presents a novel direct manipulation
technique for tracing algorithms that tries to bridge the gap between
these two existing techniques. Using a compact and expressive direct
manipulation (DM) gesture set, the user can demonstrate changes to data
structures rather than tediously drawing before-and-after snapshots. We
have implemented this gesture set in a prototype Web-based tool called
CodeInk. When the user directly manipulates data structures in CodeInk,
it records a trace as an interactive set of program steps, where each
user gesture is translated to a line of Python code or explanatory
English. The steps provide three main benefits: feedback on user
interactions, navigation through the trace, and a persistent, structured
format that can be easily disseminated and analyzed as a basis for
discussion.

\fig{fig:codeink-intro} shows how an instructor can explain the merge
sort algorithm by dragging an example list onto the canvas, selecting
sublists with a rectangular selection, dragging them away to create
copies, then merging elements by dragging them into a new sorted list
(\fig{fig:codeink-intro}a). Every interaction is interpreted as a step
in Python (\fig{fig:codeink-intro}c). The trace can then be shared with
students, who can navigate through the explanation by clicking on steps
(\fig{fig:codeink-intro}b), and then trace the algorithm for themselves
on a new example. Their own trace can be shared with teachers as a basis
for feedback on not just the final output, but also the process by which
the list was sorted.

%We have built CodeInk, a system that enables teachers and students to trace an
%algorithm's behavior by directly manipulating visual objects on a stage. The
%objects represent data structures as they are typically drawn (lists, trees,
%graphs) and can be manipulated using a set of DM gestures to demonstrate
%concrete changes to values and pointer assignments. CodeInk translates all
%interactions into a list of steps, which can be used to navigate through the
%algorithm's trace. In the case where a student is tracing the algorithm's
%behavior, the steps capture their understanding in a structured format, making
%the demonstration analyzable where screencasts, and audio/video recordings are
%not.

\pg{talk broader about future implications for this sort of technique}

This paper makes the following primary contributions:

\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep1pt

\item A novel, compact, and expressive direct manipulation (DM) gesture
set for demonstrating changes to list, tree and graph data structures.

\item CodeInk: a CS education tool that implements the DM gesture set to
enhance the experience of tracing algorithms on example data structures.

\item An evaluation of CodeInk's viability in a controlled study, where
students watched CodeInk-produced traces to learn an algorithm, and then
used CodeInk to trace the algorithm by themselves to solidify their
understanding.

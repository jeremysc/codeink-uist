\section{Related Work}

Code-driven visualization tools~\cite{Guo2013, Sorva2013} generate
step-by-step animations of code snippet execution. While powerful for
understanding snippets, they are not as good for understanding an
algorithm's high-level behavior, because they work at the wrong level
of abstraction -- i.e., the {\em implementation} of the algorithm in a
particular language. Algorithm visualizations ~\cite{AlgoViz}, address
this problem by operating at an appropriate level of
abstraction, but must be hand-coded for each algorithm.

CodeInk offers an alternative, low-effort method of authoring
visualizations. It also enables students to learn by playing the role of the computer, 
actively tracing algorithm behavior, thereby providing 
active learning, which is known 
to result in better pedagogical outcomes~\cite{Sorva2012Diss}.

% Sorva et al.\ provide a comprehensive survey of 44 such tools
% for languages such as Java, C++, and Python~\cite{Sorva2013}.

%To enable teachers to find and integrate suitable
%visualizations into their curriculula, Shaffer et al.\ created the AlgoViz
%Portal~\cite{AlgoViz}, a website that catalogues and ranks hundreds of existing
%visualizations.

%Shaffer et al.\ surveyed CS instructors and found that while there was high interest in these visualizations, 
% few used them in practice due to the difficulty of finding and integrating
% suitable visualizations into their curriculum~\cite{Shaffer2011}.

Visual programming languages
(e.g.,~\cite{Alice2008},~\cite{Scratch2008}), have a similar spirit,
in enabling writing programs by directly manipulating graphical
elements rather than by typing text. CodeInk differs in intent,
introducing a new visual language that enables users to trace
algorithms by direct manipulation of data structures.

\begin{comment}
Direct manipulation (DM) user interfaces~\cite{Hutchins1985}, starting with
Shneiderman's initial definiton of the term~\cite{Shneiderman1982}, have long
been recognized to promote more satisfactory reactions among users than
command-line or WIMP interfaces. CodeInk's DM gesture set was designed with
these princples in mind: algorithm steps can be described using physical actions
(grabbing and dragging data structures), lowering the degree of indirection
between onscreen objects and the abstract data structures they represent. For
example, list elements can be rearranged by grabbing elements and moving them
into new positions, rather than by writing code or using menus.

% DM environments for programming by
%demonstration~\cite{Cypher1993} enable users to construct programs by
%demonstrating how the program should behave on specific examples, from which
%% the system refines its understanding of the program. CodeInk's focus is on
% traces of
%algorithms, rather than general programs.


\begin{comment}
Programming by example~\cite{Lieberman2001} enables the user to write programs by
providing example input-output pairs. A related technique, programming by
demonstration~\cite{Cypher1993}, lets the user demonstrate individual steps
using a direct manipulation UI. Tools that embody these techniques often
generalize the user's actions to synthesize programs that operate on new,
unknown inputs~\cite{Yessenov2013, Kandel2011}.
% Common use cases include synthesizing text editing~\cite{Yessenov2013} and
% data cleaning~\cite{Kandel2011} scripts.
CodeInk takes inspiration from these tools and allows the user to explain
algorithms by demonstration, rather than by writing code. CodeInk does not yet
provide generalization capabilities; we plan to add that in future work.

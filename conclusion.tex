\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the design of \emph{CodeInk}, a system for
tracing algorithms by direct manipulation (DM) of data structures. Its
DM gesture set enables users to transform lists, trees, and graphs,
rather than having to tediously draw storyboards of an algorithm's
behavior. The user-described trace is recorded
as interactive program steps, in Python or explanatory English, which
enables navigation through the trace, and which can be shared and used as a
basis for targeted feedback. In an initial study that evaluated
CodeInk's viability as a tool in CS education, we found that students
were able to learn as effectively from a CodeInk-produced explanation as
from standard lecture videos, and that they could use CodeInk to trace
the learned algorithm on new example data structures.

%We plan to extend the coverage of CodeInk's vocabulary to more data
%structures and algorithms. We are also prototyping gestures for flow
%control as a step toward an environment for describing general programs,
%not just concrete traces, by direct manipulation.

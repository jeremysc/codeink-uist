\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the design of a novel direct manipulation (DM)
language for describing algorithm traces on visualized data structures,
and CodeInk, a prototype algorithm animation tool that implements this
language. Our language provides a mapping from DM gestures to primitive
program behaviors that occur in list, binary tree, and graph algorithms
commonly taught in CS courses. Using CodeInk, teachers and students can
explain an algorithm's behavior through worked examples by setting up
and directly manipulating an example data structure to trace the
algorithm's behavior. Every interaction is recorded as a step of Python
code, which the user can select to jump to that point in the trace.

This trace can be used in the classroom or disseminated online. Students
can step through it to learn the algorithm and solidify their
understanding by tracing the algorithm on new input data.

In a study that evaluated CodeInk's usability on students and teaching
assistants from introductory CS classes at MIT, subjects found CodeInk
easier to use and more helpful than a traditional drawing tool for
explaining sorting algorithms.

We plan to extend the coverage of our direct manipulation language to
more data structures and algorithms in CS education. We are also
prototyping gestures for flow control as a step toward building a full
environment for programming by direct manipulation.

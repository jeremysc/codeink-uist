\section{CodeInk: an algorithm tracing tool}
CodeInk (\fig{fig:codeink-intro}) is a Web-based tool that enables teachers and
students to trace algorithms by direct manipulation. The system consists of
three components: (1) a data palette for constructing examples of data
structures, (2) a DM gesture set for demonstrating changes to the data
structures, and (3) the recorded trace.
% which both enables navigation through the trace and can be disseminated or
% analyzed as a basis for feedback.
Its usage model is the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Setup a concrete example of a data structure (number, list, binary tree,
graph) by dragging objects from the data palette onto the canvas and
initializing their values.

\item Directly manipulate the data structure using CodeInk's gesture set to
carry out an algorithm's trace on the example.

\item Every interaction adds a step to the recorded trace, translated into
Python or explanatory English (\fig{fig:codeink-intro}c). Click on any step to
jump to the corresponding point in the trace, or play back the trace using the
controls in \fig{fig:codeink-intro}b.

\item Share the explanation by generating a URL, embedding into a Web page, or
exporting as a video. The trace is machine-readable (lines of Python), meaning
it could be analyzed automatically to provide feedback at scale.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Palette}
The teacher or student begins by setting up an example on which an algorithm
will be traced. This can be done by dragging data structures from the Data
Palette onto the stage (\fig{fig:visual_vocab}). Each data structure can be
initialized by entering a numeric value into a prompt (list elements can be set
by entering a comma-separated list of numbers). CodeInk's current visual
vocabulary supports numeric values, which is sufficient for explaining most
sorting and search algorithms. We discuss extensions of the vocabulary in the
future work section. The \emph{finger} can be used to express the current
traversal point in an algorithm, like a \emph{curr} pointer. In an educational
setting, the finger replaces the instructor pointing to a particular object
during lecture.

\subsection{Recorded Trace}

%Each gesture is translated to a line of Python or
%explanatory English, effectively recording the trace as a set of program steps.
% The steps are interactive, enabling the user to navigate through the trace by
% single-stepping
%or clicking to jump between steps. The recorded trace can also be shared
% between teachers and students, enabling dissemnation, discussion and feedback.

\subsection{Scope: concrete traces and visual problems}

Second, this work focuses on supporting traces on lists, binary trees, and
graphs, because their canonical algorithms -- sorting, rotation, search and
shortest paths -- are widely taught in introductory CS and algorithms classes.
These data structures and their associated algorithms are also inherently
visual: The natural way to teach and think through them is by drawing diagrams.
Thus, we envision direct manipulation for tracing to be most useful for these
types of problems.
% Also, they represent around \todo{50\%} of the algorithms covered in
% CLRS~\cite{Cormen2001}, one of the most popular algorithms textbooks.
In \sec{sec:design-and-future-work}, we discuss how our language can be extended
to support demonstrations of an algorithm's general behavior across more kinds
of data structures.

\section{CodeInk: A system for tracing algorithms}
CodeInk (\fig{fig:codeink-intro}) enables
tracing algorithms by direct manipulation via 
three components: (1) a data palette for constructing data
structure examples, (2) a DM gesture set for demonstrating changes to the 
structures, and (3) the recorded trace.
% which both enables navigation through the trace and can be disseminated or
% analyzed as a basis for feedback.
Its usage model is the following:

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt

\item Set up a concrete example of a data structure (number, list, binary tree,
graph) by dragging objects from the data palette onto the canvas and
initializing their values.

\item  Trace an algorithm's operation on the example by manipulating the data structure using CodeInk's DM gesture set.


\item Every interaction adds to the recorded trace a step described in 
Python, (\fig{fig:codeink-intro}c). The user can click on any step to
jump to the corresponding point in the trace, or play back the trace using the
controls in \fig{fig:codeink-intro}b.

\item Share the trace by generating a URL, embedding into a Web page, or
exporting as a video. As the steps are in Python, the trace is machine-readable, opening up the possibility of automatically generating feedback, even at scale (e.g., for a MOOC).

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Palette}
The instructor or student begins by setting up an example on which an algorithm
will be traced. This can be done by dragging data structures from the Data
Palette onto the stage (\fig{fig:visual_vocab}). Each data structure can be
initialized by entering a numeric value into a prompt (list elements can be set
by entering a comma-separated list of numbers). CodeInk's current visual
vocabulary supports numeric values, which is sufficient for explaining most
sorting and search algorithms. We discuss extensions of the vocabulary in the
future work section. The \emph{finger} can be used to express the current
traversal point in an algorithm, like a \emph{curr} pointer. In an educational
setting, the finger replaces the instructor pointing to a particular object
during lecture.

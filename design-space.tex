\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:design-and-future-work}

CodeInk supports tracing sorting and search algorithms
across lists, binary trees, and graphs, covering  one third of the algorithms in CLRS~\cite{Cormen2001}:
comparison sorts, operations on binary search and red-black trees,
breadth-first and depth-first graph traversal and some shortest path
algorithms. We plan
to extend its vocabulary to include additional data structures
(strings, linked lists, hash tables, and 2D arrays), as well as compound
structures (e.g., lists of nodes). Doing so would enable tracing a
broader class of algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming, matrix
operations) and algorithms on compound data structures (e.g., a queue of
nodes in a breadth-first traversal).

While we have thus far enabled tracing algorithms on concrete
examples, CodeInk also needs to be able to handle control abstractions
(e.g., iteration, branching recursion). Our future efforts will work
to extend CodeInk to include gestures for specifying flow control. We
are, for example, prototyping gestures for describing iteration by
tapping objects and controlling the loop's execution by dragging a
slider between those objects. Our vision is to bring CodeInk beyond
algorithm traces to bridge the gap from concrete examples to abstract
program behavior.
